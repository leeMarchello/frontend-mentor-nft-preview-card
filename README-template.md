### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

I wanted to implement this design without using flexbox or grid and just building it out with the regular css properties and I found one particular challenge that I usually solve with flexbox which is to align items on the vertical axis and discovered that I can use the `vertical-align` property to place the avatar image and text inline with each other.

Here is a code snippet of how it was performed:

```css
/* All child elements of the enclosing parent element will be aligned with each other */
.card_footer > * {
  vertical-align: middle;
}
```
